This repo contains MDB mini-project 1, "Match the Members".

The app is meant to teach new members the names of other members through a trivia game. It randomly selects a member, pulls up their picture, and displays their name along with three other random member names. If the user selects the correct member, the name flashes green and their score increases. If the user selects an incorrect member, the name flashes red. A user is only given five seconds to answer each question; after that time, the next continues. The user may pause and restart the game at any time using the Start/Stop button. Additionally, the user can monitor their longest streak of correct selections as well as the outcome of their three most recent selections in the Stats page.
